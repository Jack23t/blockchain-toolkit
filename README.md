## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates how blockchain transaction data (XRP, XLM, ADA, etc.) can be mapped into ISO 20022 payment message structures (pacs.008, camt.053).  
It bridges on-chain payments with traditional financial messaging systems.

---

## ✨ Features
- Map a blockchain transaction hash → ISO 20022 XML/JSON structure  
- Retrieve live on-chain data (amount, sender, receiver, timestamp)  
- Supports XRP and other ISO-aligned networks  
- Uses CoinGecko, CoinAPI, and CMC as data sources  
- Clean UI demo hosted on Replit  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- JavaScript / Python  
- Fetch API / Axios  
- CoinGecko API  
- CoinAPI  
- Replit (for UI hosting + demo)

## 📄 How It Works
1. User inputs a transaction hash  
2. Toolkit retrieves real blockchain data  
3. Fields (sender, receiver, amount, timestamp) are mapped to ISO 20022 tags  
4. Output generated in ISO-friendly XML or JSON format

## 🧠 Why I Built This
Financial institutions globally are migrating to ISO 20022.  
This project explores how blockchain networks and tokenized payments can interface with that standard, creating a potential bridge between DeFi and traditional finance rails.
